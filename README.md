# Flappy bird clone
I tried to make a flappy bird clone with godot. It had some bugs, but is playable :).

Gdscript is like python a easy to learn language, and... it's very intuitive, i think.

I tried to follow the workflow of the sample game in the documentation.

>**NOTE**: To improve the code, i should change positioning the character from the main scene or the scene instanciate it. Same with obstacles and background.
